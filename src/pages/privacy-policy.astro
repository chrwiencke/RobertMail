			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>Last updated: {lastUpdated}</p>

			<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
			<p>At Do Not Show Me ("we", "our", or "us"), we prioritize your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our temporary email service.</p>

			<p>Important: You should have no expectation of privacy when receiving messages through our service.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Every inbox is publicly accessible to anyone</li>
				<li>Any message sent to an inbox can be read by any user</li>
				<li>There are no authentication mechanisms - this is by design</li>
				<li>Do not use this service for private or sensitive communications</li>
				<li>Important: If you use an email address with a service/company, they may continue sending emails to that address. These future emails can be viewed by anyone within one hour of their receipt</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>3. Data Collection and Usage</h2>

			<h3>3.2 Email Data</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Generated email addresses are not stored until they receive an email</li>

			<p>We do not actively collect or store IP addresses. However, Cloudflare's infrastructure may log IP addresses as part of their standard operation and security measures.</p>
			
			<h3>5.1 Rate Limiting</h3>
			<p>To prevent abuse and ensure service stability, we implement rate limiting through Cloudflare's infrastructure:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Inbox refresh requests are limited to 10 requests per 10 seconds per IP address</li>
				<li>These limits are enforced using Cloudflare's IP-based rate limiting</li>
				<li>IP addresses are only used for rate limiting purposes and are not stored permanently</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>6. Cookies</h2>
			<p>We do not use any first-party cookies. Any cookies present are those required by Cloudflare's infrastructure for security and operational purposes.</p>

				<li>Analytics</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>8. Data Retention</h2>

However, please note that if you use an email address to sign up for services, those services may continue to send emails to that address. Any future emails sent to that address will be publicly viewable for one hour after they are received, even if you are no longer using the service.</p>
